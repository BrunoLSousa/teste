- *LCOM&ast; (Lack of Cohesion of Methods)*: This metric is a modified version of the current version 
of LCOM implemented in CK Tool. LCOM&ast; is a normalized metric that computes the lack of cohesion of 
class within a range of 0 to 1. Then, the closer to 1 the value of LCOM&ast; in a class, the less the cohesion 
degree of this respective class. The closer to 0 the value of LCOM&ast; in a class, the most the cohesion of 
this respective class. This implementation follows the third version of LCOM&ast; defined in [1].
